Operating Systems I is a notorious course at Oregon State University that all Computer Science students must take. 
It introduces students to the C programming language, VIM, and Linux. Students are expected to rapidly learn these new technologies
and complete smallsh, arguably the hardest project in the course and CS program. 

Smallsh is a custom UNIX shell that that is capable of executing most common shell commands. Supports common shell commands like $$, $?, $!, exit, cd, and parameter expansion. It also enables file input/output redirection and background execution of commands.
