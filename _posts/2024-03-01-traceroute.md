For my Intro to Networks class, one of our largest projects was creating our very own Traceroute program.
Traceroute is a computer networking diagnostic tool which allows a user to trace the route from a host running the traceroute program to any other host in the world.

**Takeaway**

This project heavily involved object-oriented programming with nested classes to form a general purpose library. There were a lot of interactions between various class objects that strengthened my OOP skills.
It was a lot of fun implementing key networking concepts such as round-trip times, time-to-live, and general packet features. From this, I gained a lot of perspective on how basic communication is performed on the internet.
