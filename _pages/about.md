title: "About me"

Hey, I'm Steven! Welcome to my personal corner of the internet where you can learn about me and what I'm doing. Currently, I'm studying Computer Science at Oregon State University with aspirations of becoming a software engineer. 

In my personal time, I enjoy a wide variety of activities. I'm a passionate tennis player and a huge NBA/NFL nerd when it comes to stats and analytics. When I'm not being active, I indulge in board/video games, puzzles, and going down wikipedia rabbit holes.
